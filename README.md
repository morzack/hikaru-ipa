# hikaru-ipa
Based off [hikaru](https://github.com/joaopscosta/hikaru) developed by [@joaopscosta](https://github.com/joaopscosta/), which is in turn based off [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/).
Also, kudos to [@NickOveracker](https://github.com/NickOveracker) and his [meremer](https://github.com/NickOveracker/meremer), of which I borrowed some logic.

This is effectively a variant of a site like [Real Kana](https://realkana.com) except designed to work with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

- IPA English ASCII is derived from ["The ASCII Phonetic Alphabet"](http://www.antimoon.com/how/pronunc-ascii.htm)
- [IPA French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French) and [IPA English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) are modelled after their respective Wikipedia pages
- IPA French ASCII is an abomination constructed from the [Branner symbol set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_ASCII_encodings_of_the_International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Symbols)
